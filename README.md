# DRC Endecoder

This is a simple encoder and decoder for DRC file generated by the HanTek oscilloscope. The DRC file is a binary file
that contains the waveform data of the oscilloscope. The encoder and decoder are written in RUST.

# Background

因为没有为电箱吉他买声卡，又想听到电箱吉他输出的声音，于是用hantek的示波器做了测试。测试过程中，发现hantek的示波器生成的DRC文件无法直接播放，于是写了这个工具。

Because I didn't buy a sound adapter for the electric box guitar and wanted to hear the sound output of the electric box
guitar, I tested it with hantek's oscilloscope. During the test, it was found that the DRC file generated by hantek's
oscilloscope could not be played directly, so I wrote this tool.
